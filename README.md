# module4
Tasks from module 4 of bootcamp. Implementation of function palidrome which checked tath given string is palidrom or not.
If string is a palidrom - function returns TRUE if not FALSE;

## Getting Started
This is only one file with three functions, so only download to your PC.
To check that given string is a palidrome you should call one of the function:
